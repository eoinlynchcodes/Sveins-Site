    <h1>About Andorra</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>Andorra is renowned for many things. For hiking, skiing, it's high altitude, it's beautiful mountains. Andorra's hidden gems of gravel roads have largely been kept a secret... 
        <br><br>
        The home of many a pro cyclist, it is a playground for bike riding with endless roads twisting up and down, gravel roads across mountains and valleys and everything to test the most technically able mountain bikers.

    <h2>The type of ride that is possible here:</h2>
    <p><i>
     “If starting from Andorra La vella, make your way up to La Massana. From there climb up to the CG4 direction Pal. Take the CG4 all the way to Port de Cabus. From La Vella it’s roughly 1300 m of climbing. At the summit the road turns to Gravel and becomes the Carretera de Tor. Big descent passing Tor and Noris and finally coming back on pavement in Alins. From there take a left on the L-510 down the valley to the L-504 junction, taking a right on L-504 heading north to Tavascan. From Tavascan take the Cami de Graus through Quanca. This is a nice gravel road and climbing roughly 700 m until the road ends and then turns to single track/trail. There’s some good riding and some hiking until the pass at 2100 m. Now you are in France. Some steep technical hiking downhill and some great technical descending sections. The route finally washes out on a small D road in the Ossese valley and turns into the D38. Descend until you come to the D8f. Take the D8f until the D18 junction and turn right. This takes you to the town of Vicdessos. Follow signs to Auzat. From Auzat take the D8 up the Soulcem valley. A massive climb awaits. After Soulcem lake the road turns to gravel and you keep climbing deep into the big mountains. As the gravel road comes to an end there is a small trail on the left heading up to the Port de Rat. From here about an hour of hike and bike to the 2500m pass. Then the trail drops steeply down into Andorra Arcalis ski area. The road is gravel at 1st and then become paved as you get closer to the ski station. Take the CS-380 until Ordino and now you descend all the way back to La vella. The route could be done in one very massive day but I recommend taking 2 days to really enjoy it.”
