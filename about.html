            More than 20 years ago I was exploring by bike as a young man in
            Northern Canada, Yukon and Alaska. In a strange turn of events this led
            me to my profession of 20 years in the pro peleton. I was riding gravel
            before it was cool. In those days it was what you had to do to get up
            North. I loved it then but I love it more now. The bikes and technology
            have been a big factor in that. It’s amazing what kind of terrain you
            can travel in one day on a modern gravel bike. The thing I love the most
            now, is to see people out in the mountains seeing what I get to see on a
            daily basis. The smiles on their faces after a very difficult,
            beautiful, epic day is what motivates me these days. I want our guests
            to have an experience of a lifetime and I want them to return the next
            year or next month!</i>
