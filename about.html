            <h1><u>About</u></h1>
            <p>
                "More than 20 years ago I was exploring by bike as a young man in
                Northern Canada, Yukon and Alaska. In a strange turn of events this led
                me to my profession of 20 years in the pro peleton. I was riding gravel
                before it was cool.
                <br><br>
                In those days it was what you had to do to get up
                North. I loved it then but I love it more now. The bikes and technology
                have been a big factor in that. It’s amazing what kind of terrain you
                can travel in one day on a modern gravel bike.
                <br><br>
                The thing I love the most
                now, is to see people out in the mountains seeing what I get to see on a
                daily basis. The smiles on their faces after a very difficult,
                beautiful, epic day is what motivates me these days.
                <br> <br>
                I want our guests
                to have an experience of a lifetime and I want them to return the next
                year or next month!"
