        <h2>Upcoming Training Camps:</h2>
        <p>
            Come join us in the high Garrotxa North of Girona for 5 days of gravel specific training. This will be the
            1st edition of spring training camps with Tufts adventure Tours. The terrain is wild and difficult and each
            day will be epic. The idea of these camps are to push your boundaries and step out of the comfort zone a bit
            to prepare you for the upcoming season, wether that is on the road or gravel/adventure racing. There will be
            3 guides and 3 different levels to help everyone achieve their goals. The camp will be based out of a
            beautiful old catalan farm house with all the amenities. We will have a Chef and soigneurs to make sure
            everyone has a great experience and needs are taken care of, so you can focus on the big days of training.
            We are going to have evening chats discussing how to prepare for your events covering topics such as
            lifestyle, nutrition, training load and a number of other protocols and hacks. Sit down with Svein Tuft and
            pick his brain and learn some of the tactics that allowed him to thrive in the world tour until the age of
            42. Learn from renowned adventure racer and head guide David Rovira how to tackle multi day adventure races.
            There's a wealth of knowledge in these 2 veterans of endurance sport and our aim is to help you bypass a lot
            of the typical hurdles many come across in the early years of taking on big challenges such as dirty Kanza
            or Trans alps. It will be an amazing 5 days learning together in one of the most beautiful places on the
            planet. We look forward to meeting you.
